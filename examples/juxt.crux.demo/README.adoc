= Crux Demo

A demo featuring Crux and selected components of JUXT's emerging web stack:

* Crux (Database)
* Spin (HTTP orchestration)
* Pick (Content Negotiation)
* Jinx (JSON Schema validation)
* Reap (RegEx Parsing)
* Grab (GraphQL)
* Dave (WebDav)
* Pass (Authentication inc. OpenID Connect)
* Flow (Reactive Streams)
* Apex (OpenAPI)

As is common in the Clojure eco-system, each of these components stand as
independent libraries and can be used in isolation, or together. Note that some
components depend on foundational libraries such as reap and jinx.

CAUTION: If you choose to adopt this stack as the basis for your own
application, you should be aware of the alpha-status of some of these
components. Alpha indicates that certain APIs may be still subject to
backward-incompatible changes.
